<p style="color: black;"><b>De Villiers is a right-handed batter who accumulated over 8,000 runs in Tests including 22 centuries and 46 fifties.
     He holds the record for most Test innings without registering a duck (78),[17] before being dismissed for nought against Bangladesh in November 2008.
     He also holds the second-highest individual score by a South African batsman, with 278*. Until 2012 he was an occasional wicket-keeper for South Africa,
     although after the retirement of regular Test keeper Mark Boucher and under his own captaincy he has started to regularly keep wicket for the national side in Tests,
     ODIs and T20Is. He gave up wicket-keeping in 2015 and handed the gloves to debutant Quinton de Kock.
    </bold></p>
    <p style="color: black;"><b>
     He holds the records for the fastest 50 (16 balls), 100 (31 balls) and 150 (64 balls) of all time in One Day Internationals by any batsmen,
     and also holds the fastest hundred by a South African in Tests and the fastest 50 by South African in T20Is.
     He is a three-time ICC ODI player of the year, winning the award in 2010, 2014 and 2015.
     After the 2011 Cricket World Cup he succeeded Graeme Smith as captain of the national ODI side,
     and became Test captain after the second Test of the home series against England in 2015/16.
     He stepped down from Test captaincy in December 2016 due to an elbow injury which kept him out of the team for a long period.
